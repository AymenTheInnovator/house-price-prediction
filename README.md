 House Price Prediction

This is a simple Machine Learning project that predicts house prices based on area (square feet) using **Linear Regression**. The model is trained using a small dataset and demonstrates the basic workflow of a supervised ML task.

Project Overview

This mini project is designed for ML beginners to understand the concepts of:
- Simple Linear Regression
- Data preprocessing
- Training and testing a model
- Model evaluation (MSE)
- Plotting regression lines using Matplotlib

Dataset

The dataset `house_data.csv` contains 2 columns:
- `area` (in square feet)
- `price` (in currency unit, e.g., USD)

You can also edit this file or add more data to improve model performance.

How to Run This Project

### 1. Clone this repository (optional)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
 Run the notebook
Open house_price_prediction.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Requirements
All required libraries are listed in requirements.txt. Main libraries used:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn

Output Visualization
The model generates a scatter plot of the data and overlays the best-fit regression line like this:


(You can add your actual plot screenshot or output here.)

Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure prediction accuracy.

Future Improvements
Add more features like number of rooms, location, etc.

Use Multiple Linear Regression

Integrate with a web interface using Flask or Streamlit
